#Color Scheme Generator

https://arslonga83.github.io/color-scheme-generator/

This is a solo project from the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path. The user can select a seed color and mode and is returned a color scheme from the colorsAPI. I added a stretch goal of making it so the user can click any color in the palette to copy the hex value to the clipboard, and included two modal popups to try to make this feature more obvious.

I've enjoyed all the solo projects so far, but this one was especially fun. I've used similar online tools before, so it feels pretty sick to know I built this one all by myself!
